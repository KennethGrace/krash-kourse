# Krash Kourse
An introductory course to developing infrastructure automation solutions with Python. This course will take you through an introduction to Python objects and control flow, JSON and XML encoding, and the basics of the requests library for making API calls. This course is meant for absolute beginners, but experienced professionals may still find some useful information.

## Getting Started
If you would like to run these programs for yourself, you should begin by downloading the latest versions of Python 3 and Git. Otherwise, if you'd only like to read along, you may skip this section and continue [here](#table-of-contents)
* For Windows, Download Git for Windows at [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* For Mac and Linux, follow instructions at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Insure that your Python 3 installation is installed properly and you are using the expected version. To do so, run the following command in your terminal.
```commandline
python --version
```

Now you can use Git to retrieve this repository, so you may run the provided programs and make your own changes. Run the following command in a directory of your choosing.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/KennethGrace/krash-kourse.git
```

Finally, to validate everything is running as it should be try running the `hello-world.py` script located in the root of this directory.

```commandline
python hello-world.py
```

Congratulations! You're done with the basic setup. You may be asked to install additional libraries throughout the course, but instructions for doing so will be provided at that time.

## Table of Contents
This course is organized into several directories each of which covers a particular aspect of automation with Python. Each directory will host several example scripts as well as a `README.md` containing a step-by-step breakdown of the same scripts.

1. [Objects in Python](/objects)
2. [Control Flow in Python](/control)
3. [Imports and Files in Python](/imports)
4. [JSON and XML Encoding](/encoding)
